# StyleGuide

This style guide includes conventions and guidelines for several languages. 
The focus lays on merging several guidelines and to simplify them as far as possible.

A few workarounds/fixes are included too, in case the browser or the programming language doesn't work as the intended.

Feel free to suggest any updates by creating pull requests or issues.
